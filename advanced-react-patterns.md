ðŸ§  Advanced React Patterns You Should Know
ðŸ“… December 15, 2024,

React has matured over the years, and modern applications often demand more than just components and hooks. Letâ€™s explore a few advanced patterns that will help you build scalable, maintainable React applications.

1. Render Props
Useful for sharing code across components. It enables passing a function as a prop to decide what to render.

2. Higher-Order Components (HOC)
Wraps one component with another. Best for reusability and logic sharing, although hooks are replacing many HOCs.

3. Custom Hooks
Abstract logic into reusable functions. Cleaner than HOCs and more aligned with React's functional nature.

4. Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components
Knowing when to use each helps you manage form states more efficiently.

5. Compound Components
Allows multiple components to share state through React contextâ€”ideal for complex UI components like tabs or dropdowns.

Mastering these patterns helps in writing better-structured code, especially for large-scale apps.
