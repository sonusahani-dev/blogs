üåê Building Scalable Web Apps with Next.js and TypeScript
üìÖ November 10, 2023

Next.js with TypeScript is a powerful combo for creating robust web apps with built-in performance and developer productivity.

1. Why Next.js?
File-based routing

Server-side rendering (SSR)

API routes out of the box

Static site generation (SSG)

2. Why TypeScript?
Type safety reduces bugs

Better code completion and refactoring

More readable and maintainable code

3. Key Practices
Use .tsx files for components

Define types for props and state

Use getStaticProps and getServerSideProps for data fetching

Organize project structure (pages, components, utils)

4. Tooling
Use ESLint, Prettier, and VSCode with TypeScript extensions for a better DX (Developer Experience).

This combination empowers you to create fast, production-ready apps that scale easily as requirements grow.
