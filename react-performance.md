âš¡ Optimizing React App Performance
ðŸ“… November 28, 2024

Performance is critical for user experience. Here are key strategies to keep your React apps fast and responsive:

1. Code Splitting
Use React.lazy() and Suspense to load components only when needed.

2. Memoization
Use React.memo for components and useMemo/useCallback for functions and values that donâ€™t change often.

3. Virtualization
Use libraries like react-window or react-virtualized when rendering long lists.

4. Avoid Unnecessary Renders
Use keys wisely, structure state effectively, and break down components.

5. Image Optimization
Compress images and use lazy loading.

With these techniques, youâ€™ll notice improved load time, responsiveness, and overall user satisfaction.
